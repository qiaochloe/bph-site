      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Puzzlethon is an event where we write, test, and publish an entire puzzlehunt in 24 hours.</li>
        <li>It's light-hearted, low-stakes, and a great way to get into writing puzzles if you're a Brown/RISD student.</li>
        <li>We'll also be livestreaming the event. If you're curious about taking a look behind the scenes to see what goes into writing a puzzlehunt, check it out!</li>
        <li>
          Making a puzzlehunt requires all kinds of people with many different skillsets: we need writers, programmers, artists, testers, and more. If you're interested in participating in Puzzlethon (and you're a Brown or RISD student), fill out this form!

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>A puzzlehunt is an event where teams of people compete to solve puzzles. These puzzles can be anything: word games, logic puzzles, video games, physical objects, or in-person challenges.</li>
        <li>For a (much larger) example, take a look at last year's Brown Puzzlehunt.</li>
